**AetherSec** is a professional-grade, modular cybersecurity platform designed for ethical red-teaming, vulnerability research, and proactive exploit simulation.

> “We get our hands dirty so others stay clean.”

NOTE:
This is currently a work in progress, this is still in active development and may have bugs or security exploits, use at own risk.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔍 **Modular Exploit Engine** — Tiered exploit system from basic scans to advanced multi-stage.
- 🔐 **Ethical by Design** — Built with safety in mind. No real weaponization or illegal activity.
- 🧠 **Advanced Intelligence Modules** — Fingerprinting, misconfig detection, honeypot avoidance, and more.
- 💾 **C# Native** — Built in .NET with performance, portability, and integration in mind.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- Windows/Linux (tested on both)
- Admin/root access (for low-level tests)

### 🧪 Build & Run

```
dotnet build
dotnet run --project AetherSec
```

Or run a specific exploit:

```
dotnet run --project AetherSec -- --target 192.168.1.100 --exploit [EXPLOIT_NAME]
```

## 🧩 Module Tiers

| Tier | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Tier 1 | Basic surface scans & port checks |
| Tier 2 | Known CVEs & weak configurations |
| Tier 3 | Evasive techniques & misconfigs |
| Tier 4 | Subdomain brute-forcing, honeypots, cloud exposures |
| Tier 5 | Multi-stage attack simulations (e.g. Log4Shell, SSRF, cloud theft) |
